# Kato
## A new way of managing your $HOME

Kato is a butler for your $HOME. He is named after Inspector Clouseau&rsquo;s
butler from the Pink Panther series of movies. Kato looks after your dotfiles,
your $PATH, your ~/bin, cleans up for you, and more.

### Can I get Kato for my $HOME?

Kato is an NPM package so he is easy to install, you just need to have
[node](http://nodejs.org/) installed.

`npm install -g kato`

Kato is not quite ready for employment yet, but when he is, you&rsquo;ll
wonder what you did without him.

### Stay tuned for more developments.
